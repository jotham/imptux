DEPENDENCIES:
===============================================================================

  Python 2.5+:       http://www.python.org/
  Pyglet 1.1.2+:     http://www.pyglet.org/

For joystick support you will probably need libsdl somewhere on your system.
I have bundled the windows DLL with this game.


RUNNING THE GAME:
===============================================================================

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "main.py" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python main.py


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
===============================================================================

A D - Move left. Move right.
J K - Fire type A. Fire type B. Different enemies require different munitions.
F   - Fullscreen toggle.
M   - Music toggle.
H   - In-game key reference.
ESC - Terminate program.

Limited joystick support is also avaliable (and recommended) if you have
libsdl installed.  This is usually installed with pygame.

Good luck, Have fun!
