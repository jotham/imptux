Special thanks to my friend Dylan who made the soundtrack!

DEPENDENCIES:
===============================================================================

  Python 2.5+ (Not python 3.x!): http://www.python.org/
  Pyglet 1.1.2+:                 http://www.pyglet.org/
  
And if you are on Linux, you might need:

  AVBin              http://code.google.com/p/avbin/

For joystick support you will probably need libsdl somewhere on your system.
I have bundled the windows DLL with this game.


RUNNING THE GAME:
===============================================================================

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "main.py" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python main.py


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
===============================================================================

Controls

  A D - Move left. Move right.
  J K - Fire type A. Fire type B. Different enemies require different
        munitions.
  F   - Fullscreen toggle.
  M   - Music toggle.
  H   - In-game key reference.
  ESC - Terminate program.

Limited joystick support is also avaliable (and recommended) if you have
libsdl installed.  This is usually installed with pygame.

Right now there is only one 'level' (set of patterns).  But if people are
interested I'll probably work on it more.

Good luck, Have fun!
